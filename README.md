# PoissonReconstruction
This is a Rust implementation of the [Screened poisson reconstruction](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/MyPapers/ToG13.pdf)
by Kazhdan and Hoppe.

## Features
Given a set of points and normals, the `PoissonReconstruction` will generate an implicit function from which the
reconstructed surface can be extracted.

```rust
let poisson = PoissonReconstruction::from_points_and_normals(
    &points, &normals, 0.0, 4, 5, 10
);
let mesh_vertices = poisson.reconstruct_mesh();
```

The `PoissonReconstruction` representing an implicit function, it can be evaluated at space locations with
`PoissonReconstruction::eval`. For convenience, a very basic isosurface extraction based on marching-cubes is provided
with `PoissonReconstruction::reconstruct_mesh()`.

## Limitations
Some of the speed optimizations described in the Kazhdan et al. paper. Namely, it currently doesnâ€™t implement the
hierarchical clustering of point optimization nor the conforming version of the castadic solver.
