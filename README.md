# PoissonReconstruction
This is a Rust implementation of the Screened Poisson Reconstruction surface reconstruction algorithm. This
implementation comes courtesy of Foresight Mining Software Corporation who sponsor its creation and maintenance.

## Reference papers
- [Poisson Surface Reconstruction](https://hhoppe.com/poissonrecon.pdf) by Kazhdan, Bolitho, and Hoppe.
- [Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/MyPapers/ToG13.pdf) by Kazhdan and Hoppe.

## Features
Given a set of points and normals, the `PoissonReconstruction` will generate an implicit function from which the
reconstructed surface can be extracted.

```rust
let poisson = PoissonReconstruction::from_points_and_normals(
    &points, &normals, 0.0, 4, 5, 10
);
let mesh_vertices = poisson.reconstruct_mesh();
```

The `PoissonReconstruction` representing an implicit function, it can be evaluated at space locations with
`PoissonReconstruction::eval`. For convenience, a very basic isosurface extraction based on marching-cubes is provided
with `PoissonReconstruction::reconstruct_mesh()`.

## Limitations
Some speed optimizations described in the Kazhdan et al. paper. Namely, it currently doesnâ€™t implement the
hierarchical clustering of point optimization nor the conforming version of the castadic solver.
